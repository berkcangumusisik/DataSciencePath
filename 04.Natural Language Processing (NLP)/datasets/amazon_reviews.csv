A1LP4NB5X34HF8,B007WTAJTO,A.Fenderson,"[3, 3]","**Update 6.24.14**My 128 GB card stopped allowing writes via any of my card-readers on a Windows PC--either when it was inside any of several full-size SD card adapters (with the write-protect tab in either position) or plugged directly into the microSD slot of the reader.  MicroSD cards have no write-protect tab, so I was quite surprised and worried by this.  After failing to find any workable solution by searching online, I finally put it in my Chromebook and created a new folder on it there, then stuck it back in my Windows PC and it no longer gave me a write-protect error.  If anyone has a similar problem, I'd recommend doing something similar by putting it in any other PC, laptop, camera, etc you have available and try writing to it there.----------------------------------------------This portion of my review is necessarily being written as an update to my original review of the 64 GB version of this card, since Amazon disallows multiple reviews for what they consider the same item.  This portion concerns the 128 GB version of this card:I don't need a fast card, so the speeds on this card were not that important, besides which my test PC is not exactly high-end. Therefore I didn't count off for the speed results I got below, using a USB 2.0 card adapter, but I thought they might be relevant to some readers. While the card did reach the Class-10 and/or UHS-I requirements, it came in at under 2/3 of the claimed ""read speeds up to 30 MB/s for fast file transfer.""  Then again, running on a second PC using a different USB 2.0 card reader, none of the speeds even hit 5 MB/s, so this seems to be highly system-dependent.I only just got the card this week, and so far it works on *select* SDXC-compatible devices and exFAT-compatible operating systems:  some SDXC-compatible devices, such as the Panasonic HDC-TM40, do not allow cards larger than 64 GB (for whatever reason); this was stated in the manual, and I've confirmed this card is recognized as broken/corrupt/unusable in that device, whereas 64 GB exFAT cards work fine.  The 128 GB works fine (with original exFAT formatting) in my Toshiba Excite 7.7 Android tablet, and (predictably) not at all in my non-SDXC-compatible Galaxy Note 2 (though it possibly would if reformatted to FAT32, since a 64 GB card in FAT32 works fine there).I'll update my review to reflect any problems, issues, etc that I notice in the coming days & weeks.-----------------------------------------------------------------------CrystalDiskMark 3.0.3 (C) 2007-2013 hiyohiyoCrystal Dew World : [url removed as per Amazon rules]-----------------------------------------------------------------------* MB/s = 1,000,000 byte/s [SATA/300 = 300,000,000 byte/s]Sequential Read : 18.694 MB/sSequential Write : 11.921 MB/sRandom Read 512KB : 18.502 MB/sRandom Write 512KB : 0.680 MB/sRandom Read 4KB (QD=1) : 3.339 MB/s [ 815.1 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=1) : 1.581 MB/s [ 386.1 IOPS]Random Read 4KB (QD=32) : 3.151 MB/s [ 769.4 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=32) : 1.564 MB/s [ 381.8 IOPS]Test : 1000 MB [G: 0.0% (0.0/119.1 GB)] (x5)Date : 2014/04/24 16:53:49OS : Windows XP Professional SP3 [5.1 Build 2600] (x86)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The following is my original review of the 64 GB version of this card, published April 24, 2013:This is a high-quality card.  I've used it in a variety of devices, through multiple readers on different pcs, in an HD camcorder using a micro to full-sized SD adapter, and I've never once had a problem with it.  It even works at full capacity in *some* microSDHC-only devices once its reformatted to FAT32 (such as my SanDisk Clip+ FLAC player and supposedly even PSPs via a proper adapter, though I haven't yet tested my PSP).  I keep anticipating someone coming out with a card with equal or better capacity and speeds at a comparable price, but I haven't seen one yet.  If these were cheaper, I'd have several by now.Make sure your device can handle micro or full-sized SDXC cards, or is one of those rare gems that state they support only as high as SDHC but have been tested to work with SDXC cards such as this one once they've been manually reformatted to FAT32.",5.0,"128 GB and 64 GB versions great, but can't confirm speed claims outside of the Class ratings",1366761600,2013-04-24,593,3,3

A2Z4VVF1NTJWPB,B007WTAJTO,A. Lee,"[5, 5]","Update: providing an update with regard to SanDisk support.I bought the memory card in Aug 2012 (see original review below). In May of 2013 while on my cruise to Alaska the card went bad. During the sailing out of San Francisco it was fine as I used it to take a panorama shot of the Golden Gate Bridge. For most of the cruise I was using my DSLR but the next time I wanted to use my cell phone, the phone told me I had no memory card loaded.  Any way, tested the card on my laptop when I got back and it couldn't recognize it. I contacted SanDisk via email and provide them copy of my receipt from Amazon along with the serial number on the back of the card (very hard to read) and no problems; they told me to send them back the card and they sent me a brand new card which is now still functioning in my cell phone.  Great support provide by SanDisk. No hassle as long as you can provide proof of purchase (easy to do since Amazon keeps my entire purchase history/invoices online).  One reason I buy directly from Amazon itself vs other vendors (either on Amazon or elsewhere on the Internet) is that I have confidence that the memory cards sold by Amazon itself are genuine.  there may be incredible deals elsewhere on the internet but in some cases the deals are too good to be true and counterfeit cards are being sold.Original review:Just received this today. Removed it from the packaging and inserted it into my Samsung Galaxy S3 (Verizon) and powered the unit back up and the storage was available.  No formatting required. Worked the first time out. Settings showed 29.71GB of total space (32GB version) and 29.71GB of free space.  I like the fact that a SD adapter came with it.  Should I ever need to insert the card into my laptop it will come in handy. (yes I can plug my phone directly to my laptop but if I ever swap this 32GB card out of my phone and replace it with a 64GB version, I can use this 32GB version via the adapter for other purposes.)",5.0,ready for use on the Galaxy S3,1346803200,2012-05-09,943,5,5

A1UM44ILLZCEI1,B007WTAJTO,Aleksandar Milivojevic,"[1, 1]","I bought 64GB version of the card to use with GoPro Hero 3 black edition.  It didn't work out.  The card worked OK if camera was set to resolution with lower bit rates.  E.g. worked fine in 720p with protune on, or 1080p with protune off.  However, in 1080p with protune on (bitrate is just shy of 6 MB/s in this mode -- much higher then with protune turned off) it was nothing but trouble.  Camera would sometime work, and sometime randomly stop recording for no obvious reason.  I first suspected camera, but testing with different SD cards, it ended up being SanDisk's card that was at fault.  My spare card, an old and cheap 16GB PNY (also class 10), worked just fine under same conditions and with same camera settings.Once it was obvious it was problem with the card, I found people on GoPro's forums that had trouble with this specific card as well (well, you always find these only after you figure it out for yourself, right?).  Anyhow, I did some speed tests with the card by doing simple write of 1GB file full of zeros using Unix dd utility to copy 1GB of zeros from /dev/zero (where else would you find that many zeros ;-) onto a file on the card.  The result was that on average, SanDisk's card would manage about 10.2 MB/s.  Just barely above the bar for class 10 card.  However, that was average over 1GB.  During the write test, the speed was oscillating with many spikes and drops.  Drops were as low as 7MB/s.  Uh.  I thought write speed of class 10 card should never dip below 10 MB/s?  For comparison, my old cheap class 10 PNY card was chugging along at constant 13 MB/s under the same test.  No spikes and no drops in speed.The card will probably work fine in most devices, as bitrates when recording 1080p video are often low enough and/or camera might have huge buffer.  But if you want to use it to record video at high bitrates, and your device doesn't have huge buffer to compensate for speed bumps of this card, you may run into trouble.  Be wary of using it in Hero3 in modes that have higher bit rates (e.g. 1080p with protune enabled).SanDisk's website lists part numbers as SDSDQUI-064G with adapter, and SDSDQUA-064G without adapter.  This conflicts with product description on Amazon.  While this is likely just Amazon not getting product description right again (a bit too common thing), it's interesting to note.[Update Apr 20 2013]:Some numbers from testing the card.  The test is extremely simple.  Write out 1GB of zeros onto the card using standard Unix dd command to read 128KB blocks of zeroes from special device /dev/zero and write it onto the card.  128KB * 8192 = 1GB.  dd displays transfer stats once it finishes.  While dd was running, I run iostat in second terminal displaying 1 second interval stats as a measure of current speed.  This was done on the Mac.  dd command line can be used as-is to repeat test on Linux system, however iostat command is different on Linux and would need to be modified slightly.  I choose 128KB block size, as that seems to be what device drivers merges sequential writes into anyhow.  Using different block sizes, results are comparable.$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=131072 count=81928192+0 records in8192+0 records out1073741824 bytes transferred in 101.578307 secs (10570582 bytes/sec)So, 10 MB/s and all is good? Right? Wrong! iostat running in parallel with above dd command recorded this:$ iostat -d -w 1 disk2disk2KB/t tps MB/s123.11 76 9.12116.61 185 21.04122.94 49 5.88128.00 41 5.12128.00 89 11.11128.00 134 16.73128.00 69 8.61128.00 61 7.62128.00 99 12.36[ ... and so on until dd finishes writing 1GB of zeros to the card ... ]IMO, the last column should never dip under 10MB/s for card labeled class-10.For comparison, same test run against Samsung Pro 64GB micro-SD card:$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=131072 count=81928192+0 records in8192+0 records out1073741824 bytes transferred in 52.869111 secs (20309436 bytes/sec)$ iostat -d -w 1 disk2disk2KB/t tps MB/s125.30 138 16.86117.73 157 18.03123.04 150 18.00128.00 159 19.86128.00 156 19.47126.45 160 19.73128.00 150 18.72128.00 154 19.22128.00 153 19.11[ ... and so on until dd finishes writing 1GB of zeros to the card ... ]So, Samsung is on average 2x faster, but more importantly it's speed is much more constant.

I found a video on youtube to learn how to insert the card since I could find nothing on it in the phone's user guide.  It's real easy. Turn the Note phone off. Remove the Note's back plate. You see a plaque saying SD card in the upper left quadrant of the phone. Simply place the microsd card face up with the metallic pins facing down and towards the right into the depressed slot area to the left of the SD card plaque. Then slowly and gently slide the microsd card under the plaque until it clicks. If it isn't in correctly, it will tend to move back out from under the plaque. Do not force. Replace the back plate on the phone. Turn the phone on.  Go to settings, storage.  At the bottom of the page, you will see SD Card.  If the microsd card was inserted correctly, you will see the additional GBs of storage displayed there.  You will also see Reformat SD card and Remove SD card.  Use these settings to erase data from the microsd card, and to remove it from the phone.  Do not try to remove the microsd card from the phone without first activating the Remove SD Card setting.  You can damage the card and the phone.  The card came quickly and San Disk is a reliable brand.

If you want to use them for shooting high definition raw footage however, I suggest you not to loose your money on this, because even if your write speeds are around 10mb/s as the card begins to decay it will slow down to become useless.Again this review is based on GoPro camera and high definition raw recording..

I'm not sure what else I can say other than that I have no problems with it and it hasn't died on my yet.It's been about 4 months at least now in my Samsung Galaxy S3. The S3 had a reputation for breaking sandisk sd cards for some reason and it's only randomly unmounted about 3 times but easily remounted with a take out and put back in with maybe a restart on the phone to refresh some apps to see it. I think this is just because the Galaxy S3 tends to get really hot right below the sd card which might damage it a bit.

Simple explanation:1) I loaded all my HD movies onto this micro SD card, inserted it into my Samsung Galaxy S3, and it plays them superbly without ANY delays, as it it up to 30mb/s read speed!2) The most important reason for this being the best accessory for your phone is to think about this: The premium you pay for an iPhone 64GB is $200. The price you pay for this 64GB micro SD card is $50 (depends on Amazon's pricing at the time). That means you get the same thing for $150 less, AND you can interchange your SD card between devices (if you buy a new tablet for example).No brainer.Note that it reads only at 10mb/s, so a 7GB HD movie will take about 10 - 15 minutes to load up.",5.0,Brilliant!

The camera came with a 4 G card which I filled in just over an hour at the local Kart track.  I missed the last bit of our race due to insufficient capacity.  The battery was still going strong so I needed more card for recording my adventures.This card fits the bill nicely.As a UHS Speed Class 1 (roughly equiv Class 10) card this SD card is quite capable of any photographic or video need up to Full HD (not 2k or 4k).  I use a similar card in my Canon 60D and am able to hold around 700 raw images, and a few hours of HD video.Here are some benchmarks for comparison including this card.MacBook Pro Retina SSD430 MB/s write323 MB/s readGeneric Class 6 4GB (Came with Ghost Camera)9.8 MB/s write21 MB/s readSanDisk Extreme Class 10 8GB21 MB/s write23 MB/s readThis Card San Disk Ultra UHC 112 MB/s write45 MB/s readWhat does this mean?  It means that you should have no trouble recording HD video reliably with this card.  Your camera will be able to save pictures quickly to this card so it is ready to take the next shot.  If you fill the card completely it will take roughly 12 minutes to copy all the data off of the card, assuming the device you are copying to can keep up.The tests were done in the built in SD card drive of the MacBook Pro using the included SD Card Adapter.Based on my tests, I would say that if you don't really need a Micro SD, then you should buy a standard SD card, your performance might be better and the price should be lower.

Now mine failed after just over 4 months, losing a bunch of photos & videos (I made sure to back up every few weeks but even so, we just lost a bunch of photos of our 2 month newborn).Clearly SanDisk had a bad batch with this lot and as the return policy is horrible, I won't be buying any more SanDisk, no matter how cheap (when we bought them on sale around January 2013 they were over half the price of similar SD cards; again, SanDisk clearly knew they had a bad batch, shame on them for dumping them on the customer, no matter how cheap).While I would presumed they would have solved the problem in production, buy at your own risk, SanDisk will sell product with ridiculous failure rate.EDIT: After submitting my review I did some more research on other sites and the low star reviews here. SanDisk is so clearly guilty of selling a defective product from the batch about 6 months ago. Which as I said before, is when they put them on a super discount sale. They knew what they were doing and they are thumbing their nose at customers who just fell outside warrantee (like myself).To knowingly sell your customer something that is going to fail at an unacceptable rate and then ignore them because it failed a little bit outside warrantee is just bad faith. I beg people considering buying this product to not do so, and thumb up the reviews warning of failures. It is only when companies lose sales do they reconsider not screwing their customers like this.Personally I have bought several SanDisk thumb drives, CompactFlash cards, and a Sandisk MP3 player. The thumb drives were ok but I wouldn't buy another mp3 player from them (it was buggy as hell).

I guess the exFAT was a successful diet), I was concerned somewhat but I ordered this one anyway and this is what my experience was. I added some music and videos onto the card using my Apple Macbook Air with no problems and then inserted it into the Note 2 with no problems and it immediately loaded everything with no problems. I have since taken it out and added some more music to it and it is working perfectly. I did not reformat or anything like that which was a great relief.

Tried it on my gf's S4 and same problem.Apparently it comes formatted as exFAT and thought maybe reformatting it as FAT32 would solve the problem. Well I thought it did since my phone finally recognized it upon inserting it. A new problem arose, though. I started taking pictures to try it out and odd thing was some of the pictures became corrupted. Not even viewable on the phone seconds after taking them. Some worked, others not.Later on, I restarted my phone for some reason or other. A while later I wanted to check the pictures again and, surprise surprise, everything was gone. I'd find out later that every time I restarted my phone everything on the card was being deleted. Tried it on my gf's phone and same thing happened.Tried reformatting again as FAT32 using GParted (couldn't hurt) and it just throws errors upon starting the write sequence.Too bad I can't return it as I had it shipped to me in Guatemala.

A1PZHJTGE2TS99,B007WTAJTO,Cat Daddy,"[5, 6]","The advertisement calls this card a ""class 10"" card however I was not able to get ""class 10"" speeds with this card. SD cards seem to be MUCH faster at read/write then microSD cards. I get about 10MB/s write speed when copying a file to my SD card through my phone USB cable. I get the same transfer rate when in an adapter. These small memory cards seem to be very limited on their write speed. Also, this card did heat up some when transferring to it for a long period of time continuously but not too bad...just warm. The read speeds seem to cap out at about 18MB/s but I did see 25MB/s on small files. One thing to note, and this may be by design for this particular card but, this card is super fast when transferring small files but slow at big files so you'll see slower write speeds the longer you write to it with larger files whereas smaller files zip along one at a time at that 10MB/s. I was getting 8.6MB/s when writing a 4.6GB movie file to this card. All in all, this is an excellent card and beyond worth the money for what you get. I love it for my EVO 4G LTE and my previous phone the EVO 4G. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it did not perform as advertised at 30MB/s.

I was thrilled I copied a ton of music onto the card and used my phone as my mobile Ipod substitute, leaving my Ipod Classic on my desktop in its speaker system cradle.Everything worked fine until a couple of weeks ago. I started getting messages that seemed to say that I had removed and inserted the memory card. Of course, I hadn't touched it. Then a few days ago the phone told me that the card contained unsupported files and that I needed to reformat it. Well, I tried reformatting. After that, nothing. Nothing at all. I pulled the memory card, reset the phone. Reinserted the card. Nothing. I tried the card in the adapter on 3 computers. It wasn't even visible.I called Sandisk tech support. It didn't take terribly long to convince them that I had a problem. But they quickly offered me two 16 gb cards as a replacement. I literally laughed at them. I got the disturbing sense that this is something that they are required to try. If so, that's a lousy business practice. After bouncing me around a few time, they agreed to send me an RMA and a shipping label. I duly sent the card off a couple of days ago. To be frank, I have no idea at all when I might receive a replacement.If I weren't already in the grips of Sandisk, I would buy another card. The fact that 10% of the comments here are negative is an indication of a real quality control problem. A 10% fail rate is simply unacceptable for a product such as this.Update: Well, I do have to give Sandisk credit for customer support. I returned the card using the supplied UPS label on a Tuesday and I received a replacement by UPS on the following Monday. That's very good service. It does, however, increase my suspicion about the offer of two 16 gb because the 32 gb cards were ""out of stock."" If they were out of stock, they sure got ""in stock"" in a big hurry.

A24F83KRAZKWR5,B007WTAJTO,Craig,"[0, 0]","Of late, Sandisk appears to have lost their way a little with their flash storage products. It's almost a universal truth that all of their USB flash drives are hopelessly slow; while they're usually reliable, transfer rates of 4MB/sec or less are worthless when filling a 32GB drive. Fortunately, their ""Ultra"" line of SD cards still appears to buck this trend.Formatted as NTFS and used in anelago Mobile Nano II reader, I see write speeds on a 64-bit Linux machine at a consistent 15-16MB/sec when copying large (1GB or larger) files to this card, which more than lives up to its class 10 billing. Reads appear to run at about 19-20MB/sec.I can't comment on reliability as I've only had the card a few days, but everything I've copied so far for testing has made it onto the card (and off again) with no corruption whatsoever; the MD5 checksum of every file I've transferred matches the source. That's more than can be said for the Supertalent Pico USB drive that this SD card and reader are intended to replace, which has never been quite right (it's always occasionally randomly corrupted files of larger than 100MB or so, and the probability of 1GB or greater files surviving was near zero).32GB appears to be the sweet spot at the moment; smaller cards don't cost that much less, and larger cards are beyond the SDHC spec and into SDXC territory, which isn't yet universal in terms of device compatibility (not to mention they cost far more than double for 64GB).For what I paid for this around Thanksgiving (not part of any explicit sale, but definitely a lower price than appears usual as far as camelcamelcamel is concerned) I'm extremely satisfied.Edit: I should also mention that the included mechanical full-size SD adaptor is one of the worst I've ever encountered. There's a lot of friction when the microSD card is inserted, and it's a right bugger to get it out of the adaptor again. Thankfully I have a few other such adaptors lying around should I ever need one; this one's going in the bin.",5.0,"Cheap, fast SD card",1354579200,2012-04-12,970,0,0

They work wonderfully and I have had absolutely no problems with either. These SanDisk memory cards are 64 GB microSDXC class 10, UHS-1 cards, which are rated for transfer speeds up to 30MB/sec.The UHS class 1 designation is intended as an performance measure that indicates the card is capable of supporting real-time full HD video recording. Of course, this only works if you are using a device which is capable of writing to the card at those speeds, but most modern devices that offer full HD recording, such as camcorders, digital SLR cameras, and cell phones with built in Full HD recording do support this standard. The benefit of using a UHS-1 card on a UHS certified device is that you should not encounter the problem of buffering or your device stopping recording because it could not write fast enough.However, because these are extra high capacity, sdXC cards, you will need to make sure that your device can support microSDXC cards, and not simply microSD or microSDHC ones. The biggest difference is that the microSDXC standard uses the exFAT file system, rather than the FAT32 or NTFS systems. While most modern Android devices (and in fact most linux/unix devices) can handle that without difficulty some devices, such as older cameras, Android devices, and some Windows devices, may have difficulty with the format.Having said that, I've been using these in Nikon D80 & D7000 digital SLR cameras, as well as Samsung Galaxy S3 and Galaxy S Relay 4G phones without any difficulty, and they read & write fine on my computers.

For SDHC memory cards, 32GB is the largest size available under that technology standard, so I went with this one from Sandisk. That way I didn't have to worry about compatibility issues with any of my devices. I've used Sandisk memory products for a number of years along with many other brands, and I've always had good results from them. I'm happy to say that my experience with this card echoes that of 5,000+ other Amazon users; it's been rock steady, reliable with larger file transfers (several 2GB+ movies at a time), and performed as quickly as I'd hoped for a Class 10 card in regards to its read/write times.Aside from the existing reviews and my previous experiences with Sandisk products, I also picked up this particular card due to its UHS-1 compliance. I don't currently have any UHS-1 devices that can take advantage of the increased speed, but for the negligible cost difference, it just made sense. Standards and technology update so fast these days; any future-proofing a product can provide to extend its usable life is always appreciated.",5.0,Maximum SDHC storage capacity coupled with Sandisk's reliability and speed,1384992000,2013-11-21,382,1,1

They offered free replacement with a card that would be certain not to have the same issue mine just had, and also to attempt recovery of my items from the card.

I like to have a wide range of music to pick from when I amon vacation or traveling on an airplane long distances. I think I may have bought too much.This card is advertised as water-proof, temperature proof, X-ray proof and shock proof. I will have totake their word for it. I am not going to test it.Just for fun I put the 16GB MicroSDHC disc (30MB/s Read Speed) into its provided adapter and used itin my cheapo cheapo Toshiba Camileo HD movie camera. Even at the Full High Definition resolution of1080p/30fps this disc performed very well. No stuttering, no missed frames and all this under low lightconditions. Nice. Very Nice. Those are big files at Full HD resolution. Read on...This card is 'USH-1' enabled which means it is the fastest card available (allegedly) and should reachup to a bus interface speed of 104 MB/s; if the electronic device you are using requires it. Of courseif your card reader or device does not support that speed you will be transferring data at your usualspeed. Sort of like saying it is backward compatible but don't expect blazing speeds. You can feeddata through only so fast.Transferring RAW photos and a Full HD digital film can take a lot of time to transfer. Those are hugefiles to transfer so the USH-I enabled disc is perfect for that purpose. They are working on USH-IIwhich is supposed to allow up to 300MB/s transfers. Talk about instant gratification, we are aboutthere.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Here is a guide by the 'SD Association' with regard to Class ratings and video applications:> Class 2 for SD video recording> Class 4 and 6 for high-definition video (HD) to Full HD video recording,> Class 10 for Full HD video recording and consecutive recording of HD stills> UHS Speed Grade 1 for real-time broadcasts and large HD video files> UHS Speed Grade 3 for 4K video files-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------USH-I overkill for a media player? Probably, but for the price it was a terrific deal to get a Class 10USH-1 enabled card and have the flexibility to use it in a variety of my electronic devices. Hmm. Onsecond thought I may just keep this card for the movie camera and get another ""slower"" one for mymedia player.As usual I have had no problems with this card.

I record a lot of videos with my phone and I've been recording straight to this card in HD with no problems at all.Installation was a breeze. I took the memory card out of the package and inserted into my phone. Then my phone brought up a menu asking if I wanted to move my music, videos, and photos to the memory card. I selected all three categories, and in minutes it had moved all of my media onto the memory card. I didn't even have to do anything else. I had read some other reviews that said they had to reformat the card or mess around with moving files by hand, but I didn't have to do any of that.I haven't tried using the included SD adapter yet, but I imagine it will work as well as any other adapter. The adapter and memory card were both shipped in a little clear plastic case, which makes it easier to carry the adapter around with you.

By reading the reviews you will see that it reads/writes at a better speed than many or most cards out there right now. Much depends on your phone, how your phone's OS stores information on a card and what's inside your device. For MOST of us; you probably will not notice anything different between this card and any other GOOD quality card out there. I usually pick the fastest cards on the market when the prices drop. The main problem, speed related is when you transfer large amounts of data (usually music) onto any card. If you use a standard USB 2 connection this card won't speed that process up. If you use a USB 3 or if you actually put this card into a USB 3 reader to do the transfer; then you'll see a nice boost. If your device requires a card that the product can UTILIZE and has the OS and chipset to take advantage of this FAST card; it's a no brainer. If your device is older, if you just like storing music; then you can find a cheaper good quality card. If you find this at a good price no matter what you have...

I formatted both cards in FAT32 using Windows 7, and functioned without drama in the respective devices. I purchased the 64GB for my GoPro Hero3 Silver edition.The reason I chose the SanDisk Ultra is for the Class 10 speed rating, as well as the waterproof, shockproof, vibration proof, and X-ray proof durability. I had the 32GB Sandisk fail after 2 months of easy usage in my Samsung Galaxy S3. I don't abuse my phone and it is not subject to extreme temperature/vibrations. Sandisk replaced it under warranty but it was quite a hassle to do this.The 16GB card however, has been subject to extreme temperatures for well over 4 months: from -5F to 100F and that doesn't include solar loading from sitting under the sun, as well as 100% humidity! The 16GB card was dripping with water after I experienced water intrusion in one of my cameras, and it had been soaked in water (while operating) for several months.The packaging was easy to open by simply cutting across the top. However, finagling out the blister pack took some patience. The Frustration Free packaging is essentially a cardboard envelope sleeve with a plastic holder and the SD card adapter with microSD card inside. This is how it is shipped!Overall: 4/5 stars. Very affordable and decently fast micro SD cards. These are perfect for smartphones or recording devices used in extreme environments. However, one of them failed within 2 months. The speeds are also inconsistent. I posted a benchmark photo on Amazon showing my speeds with all 3 sizes of cards and the 32GB was the fastest.UPDATE 28 OCT 2012My 32GB card has failed after just over 2 months of use in my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone. It started dismounting/remounting intermittently by itself over night. I woke up this morning to find that the card is not readable via the phone and wouldn't work on my PC.

I connected it with its adapter to my computer's card reader to transfer about 3Gb of data and the best consistent transfer rate (average) was roughly 13Mbps... That's less than %50 of the advertised transfer rate.To be fair, I've used the same external card reader with my Sony HX100 digital camera with an SD card (16Gb class 10) and I get double the transfer rate of what I've gotten for this card.Here is the setup:1- SD Adapter included with this card.2- External 12-in-1 USB 2.0 card reader connected to a USB 2.0 port on my PC3- Files transferred were of varying sizes.4- Transferred from 2TB Seagate X2 SATA3 HDD (connected to SATA2 port)5- Windows 8 Enterprise x64 (oh yah baby)The only excuse I give this card for its bad performance is the files were relatively small sizes but some of them were as large as 50Mb...

After reading SO many negative reviews and feedback about this shipping company, I was crossing my fingers and hoping that they wouldn't do something stupid to my package. Fortunately, I got my package on time and nothing was damaged. One minor complain is that ONTRAC does not update their tracking history very often, or at all(based on my other purchases). As I was phoneless for couple days and really needed a phone, I checked the tracking history probably once every couple hours. It was showing that it has left the faculty for 2 1/2 days and was not updated at all until about an hour before I got my package saying that it went out for delivery on 9AM (I received my package around 5PM).

A2T28XGN21AZ0A,B007WTAJTO,Hubert Farnsworth,"[0, 0]","UPDATE 6/18/14: Well, I suppose nothing lasts forever. After almost a year, the card has gone bad. I use the card a lot in my smartphone - a T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy S3 (SGH-T999). All my photos, voice recordings, and downloads go on this card, and the downloads are transferred to my computer almost daily via USB cable. A few days ago, a video file I transferred to my computer refused to play correctly. No video, and the audio was skipping and squealing, which I recognize as the sound of a corrupted file. I thought maybe the transfer didn't complete; tried it again, same result. I tried to play the file right on the phone, and it didn't play on my phone! I knew there was a problem. I tried copying the video to my phone storage and playing it there, still no luck. Then I deleted the video and decided to download it directly to my phone, not the SD card - EUREKA. It played perfectly.I formatted the SDXC card twice - once from the phone and once through Windows - and tried the same test. Downloaded video file to the card, then to the phone. Same result both times - it wouldn't play on the SD card, but it did on the phone. All videos used to play perfectly on the SD card. Finally, I swapped out the card for my older, Sandisk Ultra 32GB Micro SDXC card. Like magic, it worked perfectly no matter what I played on it. So yeah, the 64GB card is dead. I should note that the card performed flawlessly for nearly a year up until a few days ago.Thankfully, Sandisk Ultra products like this carry an incredible Lifetime warranty - or 10 years for regions that don't recognize ""lifetime""; their Extreme line of cards raise that to 30 years!

A12B7ZMXFI6IXY,B007WTAJTO,"Hyoun Kim ""Faluzure""","[1952, 2020]","[[ UPDATE - 6/19/2014 ]]So my lovely wife bought me a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 for Father's Day and I've been loving it ever since.  Just as other with Samsung products, the Galaxy Tab 4 has the ability to add a microSD card to expand the memory on the device.  Since it's been over a year, I decided to do some more research to see if SanDisk offered anything new.  As of 6/19/2014, their product lineup for microSD cards from worst to best (performance-wise) are the as follows:SanDiskSanDisk UltraSanDisk Ultra PLUSSanDisk ExtremeSanDisk Extreme PLUSSanDisk Extreme PRONow, the difference between all of these cards are simply the speed in which you can read/write data to the card.  Yes, the published rating of most all these cards (except the SanDisk regular) are Class 10/UHS-I but that's just a rating... Actual real world performance does get better with each model, but with faster cards come more expensive prices.  Since Amazon doesn't carry the Ultra PLUS model of microSD card, I had to do direct comparisons between the SanDisk Ultra ($34.27), Extreme ($57.95), and Extreme PLUS ($67.95).As mentioned in my earlier review, I purchased the SanDisk Ultra for my Galaxy S4.  My question was, did I want to pay over $20 more for a card that is faster than the one I already owned?  Or I could pay almost double to get SanDisk's 2nd-most fastest microSD card.The Ultra works perfectly fine for my style of usage (storing/capturing pictures & HD video and movie playback) on my phone.  So in the end, I ended up just buying another SanDisk Ultra 64GB card.  I use my cell phone *more* than I do my tablet and if the card is good enough for my phone, it's good enough for my tablet.  I don't own a 4K HD camera or anything like that, so I honestly didn't see a need to get one of the faster cards at this time.I am now a proud owner of 2 SanDisk Ultra cards and have absolutely 0 issues with it in my Samsung devices.[[ ORIGINAL REVIEW - 5/1/2013 ]]I haven't had to buy a microSD card in a long time. The last time I bought one was for my cell phone over 2 years ago. But since my cellular contract was up, I knew I would have to get a newer card in addition to my new phone, the Samsung Galaxy S4. Reason for this is because I knew my small 16GB microSD card wasn't going to cut it.Doing research on the Galaxy S4, I wanted to get the best card possible that had decent capacity (32 GB or greater). This led me to find that the Galaxy S4 supports the microSDXC Class 10 UHS-I card, which is the fastest possible given that class. Searching for that specifically on Amazon gave me results of only 3 vendors (as of April) that makes these microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 cards. They are Sandisk (the majority), Samsung and Lexar. Nobody else makes these that are sold on Amazon.Seeing how SanDisk is a pretty good name out of the 3 (I've used them the most), I decided upon the SanDisk because Lexar was overpriced and the Samsung one was overpriced (as well as not eligible for Amazon Prime).But the scary thing is that when you filter by the SanDisk, you literally get DOZENS of options. All of them have different model numbers, different sizes, etc. Then there's that confusion of what's the difference between SDHC & SDXC?SDHC vs SDXC:SDHC stand for ""Secure Digital High Capacity"" and SDXC stands for ""Secure Digital eXtended Capacity"". Essentially these two cards are the same with the exception that SDHC only supports capcities up to 32GB and is formated with the FAT32 file system. The SDXC cards are formatted with the exFAT file system. If you use an SDXC card in a device, it must support that file system, otherwise it may not be recognizable and/or you have to reformat the card to FAT32.FAT32 vs exFAT:The differences between the two file systems means that FAT32 has a maximum file size of 4GB, limited by that file system. exFAT on the otherhand, supports file sizes up to 2TB (terabytes). The only thing you need to know here really is that it's possible your device doesn't support exFAT. If that's the case, just reformat it to FAT32. REMEMBER FORMATTING ERASES ALL DATA!To clarify the model numbers, I I hopped over to the SanDisk official webpage. What I found there is that they offer two ""highspeed"" options for SanDisk cards. These are SanDisk Extreme Pro and SanDisk Ultra. SanDisk Extreme Pro is a line that supports read speeds up to 95MB/sec, however they are SDHC only. To make things worse, they are currently only available in 16GB & 8GB capacities. Since one of my requirements was to have a lot of storage, I ruled these out.The remaining devices listed on Amazon's search were the SanDisk Ultra line. But here, confusion sets in because SanDisk separates these cards to two different devices. Cameras & mobile devices. Is there a real difference between the two or is this just a marketing stunt? Unfortunately I'm not sure but I do know the price difference between the two range from a couple cents to a few dollars. Since I wasn't sure, I opted for the one specifically targeted for mobile devices (just in case there is some kind of compatibility issue). To find the exact model number, I would go to Sandisk's webpage (sandisk.com) and compare their existing product lineup. From there, you get exact model numbers and you can then search Amazon for these model numbers. That is how I got mine (SDSDQUA-064G).As for speed tests, I haven't run any specific testing, but copying 8 GB worth of data from my PC to the card literally took just a few minutes.One last note is that Amazon attaches additional characters to the end (for example SDSDQUA-064G-AFFP-A vs SDSDQUA-064G-U46A). The difference between the two is that the ""AFFP-A"" means ""Amazon Frustration Free Packaging"". Other than that, these are exactly the same.  If you're wondering what I got (and want to use it in your Galaxy S4), I got the SDSDQUA-064G-u46A and it works like charm.",5.0,UPDATED - Great w/ Galaxy S4 & Galaxy Tab 4 10.1 - No Complaints Here!!!,1367366400,2013-01-05,702,1952,2020

Well, class &#34;10 SDHC&#34; means literally SD format, HC=High Capacity, Class 10 = 10MB/sec read-write. How fast is 10MB per second? Well, Class 4, the most common step down (i.e. cheaper) is Class 4, i.e. 4MB/sec. So Class 10 is 2.5 times faster. Why pay the difference?Digital cameras: at some point the number of pictures/sec or HD video is bottle-necked by the speed of the media it is being recorded to.Smart phones? I have a Samsung Note II.

A2HYTUOURNH4AW,B007WTAJTO,Jason J Chapman,"[2, 2]","I had bought this card for my new Samsung Galaxy S3. The card is about as good as you can expect for the price and technology you're paying for.SDXC cards come formatted in exFAT by default, which is what I would have tried to format it as anyway and seen if my phone supports that filesystem. In addition to being a faster format, enabling higher transfer rates, exFAT also takes up less storage space than, say, an FAT or FAT32 filesystem would - which is important when considering mobile storage devices.I read several poor reviews about this product starting that it simply stopped working after a few months. While that can happen from regular use, as it has happened to me in the past with a couple 32GB SDHCs, I would venture to say it was an error in use. Flash media is very sensitive in regards to ""hard shutdowns"". that's to say, just pulling it out of your device or card reader without first unmounting it. Within the 'Data Storage' menu on Android phones, there is an option to 'unmount SD card'. I would recommend that you ALWAYS select this before removing any external memory card to avoid corruption of data and, ultimately, the card itself. The reason for this is that sudden stoppage of a flash memory device's data or power connectivity can easily result in corruption.Transversely, if you have the memory card plugged into a card reader, say, with an SD adapter; you should first ""Eject"" the card. In Windows, there is a small icon located in the taskbar notification menu for ""Safely Remov[ing] Hardware and Eject[ing] Media"". Select the card and a notification will pop-up that the card is now safe to remove. It basically severs the same function as the Android 'unmount' optional but will also cease any current read/write operations to avoid data or device corruption.I cannot speak for how one would do this on a Mac OS but chances are, if you're using an Apple PC, you don't have an Android phone.",5.0,Good flash card,1349827200,2012-10-10,789,2,2

The size was decent, but I never realized until upgrading how much I was lacking on the speed.I finally got one of these to replace my old card with my Galaxy S3. It is superb. I just recently got a Galaxy S4, and again, this card is just about the best expansion you can add to most any phone.With my old MicroSD card, I had gotten used to just sitting there, zoning out, as I waited patiently for my computer to transfer pictures/videos off my card to be backed-up to my PC's hard drive, or copying some music files from my PC to my card. With this new card, almost any single file (even hundreds of megabytes big) is an instant transfer, that transfers too quick to even bring up that &#34;moving&#34; dialog box in Windows 8. On my very big transfers (lots of HD video files at once, totaling several gigabytes), I have to wait, but I'm waiting for seconds instead of minutes.Combine the excellent speed with the fact that 64GB can hold a ton of data (compared to typical storage sizes on phones), and you have a very satisfied customer. Now I can procrastinate even longer the occasional transfers of all my pictures and videos to my PC, though I try not to.A lot of phones (like my S4) specify 64GB SDXC cards as the maximum they support, so this is about the best you can even get for the moment, unless you want to pay almost double for SanDisk's Extreme cards. Unless you have money to burn, I think these are a much better value and diminishing returns certainly kick in beyond this price point. But perhaps my next phone will support 4K HD video onto 256GB cards and I will yet again need to upgrade my card's capacity and speed...

I tested it with various programs on the web that apparently can detect whether they are fakes or not. This one turned out to be a real Sandisk card. The card came formatted with FAT32.I read on the web about these micro SDs, and apparently they are not as fast as the full SD card version. I borrowed my brothers Sandisk 32gb full SD card to make comparison tests. Here are my official/unofficial test results using DiskBench V2.6.2.0 and H2testw 1.4 test. I will give the results as an ""overall"" result, because after testing these cards over and over with speed writes and reads, the results get mixed and varied to a big degree... much larger than I expected, but the numerous tests showed me a ""general"" trend. The trend is that the full SD cards do write faster than the MicroSD card. But, also remember that the microSD had to be put into an adapter to do the test on my PC while the fullSD card was put into the computer reader directly.These are just my averages, but:Small file writes:Both SD cards wrote at close to 10mb/sec. The microSD was less consistent in the tests and sometimes dropped to 8mb/sec.Small file reads:Both SD cards read at close to 20 mb/sec at their fastest.Large file copies to card:MicroSD wrote at 3.5mb/sec while the fullSD wrote at about 4mb/secLarge file reads copies from card:MicroSD was 10mb/sec while the fullSD read at about 14mb/sec.My conclusion:My tests were by no means official for this card and showed much variance dependent on file size of the reads and writes, but the fullSD card was faster in many cases, but equal to microSD in most cases. The small file writes and reads showed that they are similar enough. But, my only concern is with large file writes.... is 3.5 mb/sec good enough for rapid photography on a high pixel camera? I don't know. I have had no problem using these cards with H264 movie capture for hours. I am surprised that 3.5 mb/sec is enough.Also, never during the huge file copies to the card did I get any noticeable heating of the card itself, by touch even for an hour. I've noticed that it has been a complaint from many people on the web, some stating that they felt they might burn themselves. I copied files that took more than an hour with no noticeable temperature change, other than, perhaps a couple of degrees. Of course, this was on a PC and not installed in a camera.The card performs well for video work, and appears to meet many other tests performed by other people. I never saw a read close to 30 mb/sec... they were very consistent at 20 mb/sec at the highest performance.I would get the card again, if the price were right.",4.0,Good Card,1350691200,2012-10-20,779,1,2

While Amazon usually has great prices on these, make sure you check out sales, especially at Radio Shack, which often beat all others. (No, they don't pay me; I just like to pass along info on good deals when I spot them.) FYI: Radio Shack's sale prices on no-contract smartphones are usually tops as well. I bought my Virgin Mobile Samsung S2 from them and am loving this phone!Back to the memory card, it's so nice to have Android products that take these to expand memory, something the ""I"" guys could really take a lesson in. And if you don't think you'll need the expanded memory, trust me, with photo-taking and all the goodies you can get, you'll want it over time.As one person commented, yes, this memory card comes in various sizes, including the 32GB version I also purchased, which is the max compatible with the devices I have, although 64GB is also available for the latest tech.

It offered to format the card.I would note that I have Clockwork Recovery and the ROM Manager app installed on my rooted (CM7, Android 2.3) N1.After tapping the notification, the phone formatted the card.  All went well.  Since I had neglected to move my RootExplorer file manager off the SD card prior to putting in the new card, I was not able to check directly on the phonethat the entire 64GB was available.  But, as it turned out, it was.While doing the above, I had been using Winzip to make a copy of the contents of my 32GB card to my PC (using a USB adapter).  When that completed,I powered down the phone and put the new 64GB card in the PC using the Micro SD adapter that came with that card and a USB adapter for that adapter.It showed about 60GB (the usual for a 64GB card, I guess).Interestingly, some files (mainly folders) related to clockworkmod had been placed on the SD card during formatting, which shows where the formatting codeprobably came from.  Take note: if you do *not* have ROM Manager / Clockworkmod on your phone, your mileage may very well vary.  If you have root, I would suggest obtainingROM Manager from Google Play prior to doing the above.  Anyway, I just deleted those files so that they wouldn't conflict with any of the old files I was aboutto copy.I then unzipped the saved contents of my old card onto the new card.Then, I put the new card in the N1 and powered it up.  It worked perfectly, right away.Root Explorer showed about 60GB of capacity (of which about 30 was used by me - I really needed this card!).Tried out Spotify Premium and it played fine from saved files that had been on the old card and were now transferred to the new card.  Other thanRoot Explorer, haven't tried any other apps yet, but am expecting good news based on the experience thus far!I tried a full backup using ROM Manager and it apparently worked without incident.So, based on the above, I would recommend this card for the Nexus One!  What a break to get another 30 GB on an aging phonethat is nonetheless still one of the best phones ever.Caveat: Keep in mind that I just unwrapped this thing and have used it for all of two hours.",5.0,Nexus One Loves This Card!,1349049600,2012-01-10,1063,1,1

A12ESGQ81M70JX,B007WTAJTO,mad G.I.,"[0, 0]","I bought this card, originally for my Galaxy Note II, with the intentions of using it as my primary downloader, but I could not get it to format correctly for the phone, even using third party format software.I then tried it in my Galaxy Tab2 7.0plus......same problems.I finally, and ridiculously, put the card in my Nikon D5100 camera. I could take a whopping 8k photos, on high/large settings (not that I would ever need to take that many photos in one session). This was the last option I had, to use the card.It worked well, taking photos of a holiday, and thankfully, it did not fail before I could get my photos onto a computer. Since then, I have inserted it back in the camera, and reformatted (like you always should), and bam, one photo is good, after that, failure, every single time. So now I have a 64GB card, that is capable of taking and storing ONE PHOTO at a time, before I must run a ""fix file system"" on my computer.Don't waste your money on this card, over priced, not really faster than the other cards I have, and zero longevity. This may be a one off, but I think it is a problem created by the proprietary format exFAT, that makes this card a loser, or more to the point, the poor customer who buys it.UPDATE JULY 2012After contacting sandisk, they have offered an RMA, but first they must verify that I have not tried to ""recover"" or ""wipe"" the data on the card, and I must ship it, at my expense, to Taiwan. I have since emailed them in reply to the requested information (date of purchase, photos of the card, packaging ect), and I told them that the data on their is my data, and if I could have accessed the card, I would have wiped it, why should I give them my information, stored on the card? That makes me less than happy, I am guessing that they want to discourage returns. Who would want to send data to a company, not knowing who will access it, and what they will do with the information contained? I would have wiped the card, but it was unreadable, unable to format, unable to do anything. I will send it to them, hoping that the information is destroyed, along with the bad card.Sandisk, you are asking a whole lot of your customers, and since this card has gone bad, I have had several other cards from them, go bad as well, seems to be a whole lot of cards being shipped that die in very short time periods. I used to love their products, and their older flash drives are great, still using a micro cruzer that is 6 years old, and going strong. I have not had one single microSD card, from this company, last more than three months, since I moved to the Philippines. Either they send their junk to the Philippines, or they have dropped QC from their business model, to create higher profit margins.**UPDATE 2**After emailing Sandisk, and expressing my displeasure with having to return the item, intact, so that they can ""assess"" the card, and look at/recover what ever personal information may have been stored on the card, they rescinded. I can only assume that they want to get the card back, to verify that it is bad, or make sure that you are not just trying to get a free card out of them, which I can understand. Instead of requiring me to send the card back to them, they asked that I cut the card, and send a photo of the ""destroyed"" card, so they could process a new card, to be sent to me, directly in the Philippines. I hammered them pretty hard in this review, and in the email I sent to them, regarding the bad card, and sometimes, you get results, in this case, I give them 5 stars for doing the right thing. I had no problem cutting the card, since it would not operate in any of my devices anyway, but I did have a problem returning the device, intact, with out knowing what information was stored on the card (banking, amazon account info, passwords, ect.) I would have just kept the card, destroyed it, and never bought another from sandisk. With their faith restoring gesture, I will not remove them from my list of companies to avoid. I just hope that they get better at QC. I returned another defective card to the retailer yesterday, only to find out that you MUST have the original packaging for a replacement. I was lucky to still have one of my packages, but since I bought several of the cards, I am not sure if I gave them the matching package for the card I returned.I would suggest that if you are like me, and have several devices (2 DSLR's, galaxy Tab2, galaxy Note 2, SII, LG-P920), that you find a way to mark each card/package, and keep the package, in the case that the card should go bad.

I own two, and while the high-capacity/low-price certainly makes them useful, they're not the answer to all of my recording needs. First of all, do not use this with a GoPro Hero 3 (or later model). Despite SanDisk's claims, these cards cannot handle the demands of true HD recording. GoPro removed it from their list of recommended cards because it caused the cameras to lock up and turn off. Even with myCanon VIXIA HF10 Flash Memory High Definition Camcorder--technology which is over 10 years old--the SanDisk Ultra card does not meet the requirements for shooting in FXP mode (1920x1080, 17Mbps) even though the camera says only a class 4 is required. A firmware update to the GoPro 'fixed' the issue for Hero 3 and Hero 3+ cameras, but it did so by throttling the recording speed for the cards, i.e. lowering the quality of the recording slightly.Those shortcomings aside, the SanDisk Ultra can shoot in XP+ mode (1440 x 1080) on the Vixia HF10 and it works with all of the settings of aContourROAM Waterproof HD 1080P. Is it ""water-proof, temperature proof, X-ray proof, shock proof""? I can't say. The ContourROAM is a waterproof camera, so even non-waterproof cards are safe for submersion if they're in the housing. The Ultra has functioned in 10 weather and after being dropped, so there's validity to the claim of it being temperature- and shock-proof.

ADPDMLUDAMML0,B007WTAJTO,Mark R. Wietstock,"[1, 1]","I got my wife a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 for Christmas, and it took awhile for her to start figuring out all the things it can do.  Once she did, that led, of course, to her wanting to watch movies on it.  That was my signal to spring into action, that is, if I wanted to prevent her from running wild, buying ""digital copies"" of every movie we already have in DVD or Blu-Ray.  You can't play DVD or Blu-Ray movies on this device, but you CAN use your computer's DVD or Blu-Ray drive and commonplace third-party software to convert movies in this format into "".mp4"" and/or several other types of video files that CAN be played on this tablet.Since this particular tablet is capable of playing high-definition video (screen resolution is 1280 x 800 pixels), and we want to use ALL of that high-def capability, my conversion files tend to be pretty large (average 5 to 10GB per movie) ... way too big to be stored on the tablet's limited internal memory.  That's where the tablet's microSD slot ... and this SanDisk flash memory ... comes in.  I make HUGE mp4's, store them separately on a 1.5 terabyte drive, and then load as many of them as I can on this chip, which shows up in the tablet as a separate memory source.  Then all you have to do is pull up one of the movie files from the card, and hit play.  You can use the device's standard video player, or get an app with more controls.Watching high-def video on a tablet that's streaming the data from a memory card (rather than the tablet's internal memory) requires a memory card with very high ""read speed,"" and this SanDisk card's ""Class 10"" rating fills that bill.  That's the difference between cheaper microSD that's primarily designed for simple data storage, and microSD that's designed for higher active transfer/read speeds.  The ""Class 10"" designation generally means that the subject card will transfer data at a MINIMUM rate of 10MB per second.  This SanDisk ""Ultra"" card is capable of transferring data at speeds of up to 30MB per second, depending on the speed of the device you're using it in, and other particulars of the way you're using the device.""Frustration free packaging"" means the chip, SD adapter, and plastic case comes in a little, sealed cardboard envelope with a pull tab opener.  This card comes pre-formatted for Android, and my use of it in the Galaxy Tab 3 for watching high-def .mp4 movies has thus far been flawless.Finally, don't let yourself get burned by counterfeiters in trying to save a buck.  While pricing on memory tends to fluctuate, Amazon's current pricing on this card is VERY competitive with any/all vendors out there selling GENUINE SanDisk ""Ultra"" memory.  Buy from Amazon, or other trustworthy vendor, because I just learned the hard way that these memory cards are being counterfeited in huge numbers ... that is, the counterfeiters are placing SanDisk labeling/packaging on inferior, generic microSD, and selling the bogus chips on Ebay and anywhere else they can.  I bought THREE from Amazon after I got burned by a Chinese seller on Ebay.  The counterfeit packaging and labeling was good enough to fool me, until I actually tried one of the chips in the Galaxy Tab 3 ... the write speed (that is, the amount of time it takes to transfer files ONTO the microSD card) was dramatically worse than the speed of a genuine SanDisk ""Ultra"" card, and the read speed was totally inadequate for playing movies on the Galaxy Tab 3.  I may never have figured it out at all if I didn't already have one other, genuine SanDisk ""Ultra"" with which to compare the fakes.If you want the best, most reliable memory for the microSD slot on your shiny, new Android device, look no further ... this is it.",5.0,"""Gold standard"" for latest Android devices ...",1403913600,2014-06-28,163,1,1

As I write this review the card has been running in my Tab 3 and constantly used for over a week.Other reviews have dissected the specs of this card, so I'll share how I use it and why I prefer these over the 64GB cards (which I also own and use). The price point on these 32GB cards have dramatically fallen and as of the date of this review they are priced as commodities. I use a few pairs of these to rotate backups on my laptop, so I always have a daily snapshot of my documents. For that purpose alone these cards are well worth it.For my tablet I have divided my extensive music library into genres and have them backed up to these cards. A 32GB card will hold about 150 CDs, so the space savings along over the physical media is significant. In fact one of these cards cost about the same as a rack for 150 CDs.These are also excellent for saving practice sessions that I sometimes record using my phone or tablet. I pop my primary SD card out of the device and swap one of these in to video record. Since this card will hold about six hours of video it's perfect for that use.Overall, these are reliable cards that have worked in a number of devices I own. I can assure anyone wanting to use them in a newer Samsung Note 2 or 3 phone or Tab 3 tablet that this card will work, and it is also excellent for HD video recording. At the price point it's an absolute bargain.",5.0,Perfect for primary and temp storage,1392249600,2014-02-13,298,0,0

A36U8X10T0BFVJ,B007WTAJTO,M. Stanley Bubien,"[2, 2]","My review is a little backwards&#8230; but I thought the most relevant should go first.WARNING: ONLY BUY THIS CARD ON SALE!The *typical* price since summer 2013 is about $24 for 32 GB, and about $48 for 64 GB.  DO NOT pay any more than this, and you can actually pay less if you have the luxury of time / patience.The lowest (non-lightning) price hit about $18.00 for 32GB and $35 for 64GB, in early December.  I basically buy when the price hits $20 or less, and the 64 nears $40.00.From December 2013 to January 2014, I watched these cards change price on an almost daily basis.  They initially went on sale for about $17.95 and $34.95 for 32 and 64 respectively.  I watched them slowly increase in price, with random dips and peaks for a month.  On January 6th 2014, they still show as a &#34;Best Deal on Amazon&#34; for &#34;7 more days&#34; but they are at the highest price point since last summer -- and higher than I have *ever* payed for these cards!  So don't let the &#34;Best Deals&#34; section deceive you, at $27/$50, these are NOT a &#34;deal&#34; in terms of price.Okay, here's my actual &#34;review&#34; of these absolutely great SDXC cards.****I have tried a variety of MicroSDXC cards, and so far the Samsung Ultra UHS1 are the best -- and the price can't be beat -- for all the most important reasons: speed, capacity, reliability, durability.I have not had a single failure, and I use these cards in my Nook HD+, Nexus 7 2013 (via USB) and my Canon 5D Mark II (with converter) and MacBook Pro (In the card slot).  They're durable and waterproof, and  I can use the same card in all these devices without reformatting.  I even had one go through the wash, and I still use it for pictures.For the technically inclined, I have cards with *both* the Clockwork Mod bootloader (for the Nook HD+) and the MagicLantern firmware for my Canon EOS 5D II on the same card.  I can pull it from the Nook, shoot pictures with the camera, and look at the results on the Nook by just pulling the card out of one device and placing it in the other.  This should be possible with any SDXC/SDHC card, but it turns out that the Samsung UHS1 is the only card I've found that works reliably.  Some cards won't boot because they're too slow too finicky, but all my Samsung UHS1s work great (the 64GB will not boot in the Nook, but no 64GB card will).I keep my eyes open for price drops on these cards because they've performed so well for me.  Samsung also has a newer, faster card, but its price-point hovers somewhere north of &#34;prohibitive&#34; so I still stick with these.  And that's good news regardless because as the new card increases its market share, these should drop even further in price.",5.0,Watch Price - Great Card Often on Sale,1388966400,2014-06-01,190,2,2

After formatting it via the phone, ands changing all my phone settings to save everything to the card, I'm a happy camper.

AOEAD7DPLZE53,B007WTAJTO,NLee the Engineer,"[1428, 1505]","I have tested dozens of SDHC and micro-SDHC cards. One disturbing trend I noticed is that: the speed class rating for micro-SDHC is typically inflated. For example, a 'class-10' rating means the card must deliver a sequential write speed of at least 10MB/s. But somehow, a class-10 microSDHC cards is always slower than a class-10 SDHC card from the same manufacturer. Case in point: thePNY 32 GB microSDHC Card (P-SDU32G10-EFS2)claims to be 'class-10', yet it can only write at 8.6MB/s maximum, while the full-sizePNY P-SDHC16G10achieved 13.4MB/s according to CrystalDiskMark v3.01.ThisSanDisk Ultra 32 GB microSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 card (SDSDQUA-032G-U46A), however, proves to be the exception. It achieved a sequential write speed of over 10MB/s according to two different benchmark programs (11.8MB/s in ""CrystalDiskMark"", 10.6MB/s in ""H2testw v1.4""). This is faster than all my other microSDHC cards, including two 'class-10' cards fromPNYandPolaroid.A closer look at the file transfer speed using ""Flash Memory Toolkit"" revealed another nice surprise: For writing small files, this Sandisk Ultra microSDHC card performed just as well as its full-size counterpart, theSanDisk Ultra SDHC (SDSDU-032G-AFFP). In contrast, all my other class-10 microSDHC cards perform poorly while writing smaller files. See the benchmark results I uploaded to 'Customer Images' for details.When you use a memory card in a digital camera to record HD video, it needs to store a huge video file each session. That means its sequential write speed is most critical. When used in a tablet or a smart phone, however, the card's random write speed for small files is more important. That's why in such applications, the Sandisk microSDHC will perform faster than the PNY and Polaroid cards, even though they are also rated as 'class-10'.[Bottom Line]As of this writing, the Sandisk Ultra microSDHC card ia actually priced lower than other class-10 cards from PNY and Polaroid. This makes the Sandisk the best value - especially if you need honest class-10 performance across all platforms.[Side Notes]- Do not confuse this Sandisk Ultra card withSanDisk Mobile Ultra microSDHC (SDSDQY-032G-U46A). The latter is rated for class-6 only.- The size of this '32GB' card is 29.7GB according to my computer. This is actually normal because computer people count one Gig as ""2 to the power 30"", which is 7.3% larger than one billion. So 29.7GB translates to 31.9 billion bytes, which is '32GB' according to marketing people.[Update on Feb 4, 2013]1. Amazon combined the Sandisk Ultra 32GB and 64GB cards on the same product page. Please beware that your intended appliance must be compatible with 'SDXC' in order to used the 64GB version. My original review refers to the 32GB 'SDHC' version.2. There are two part numbers for the same card. If you start from the Amazon product page and select 'Retail Packaging', you'll see the part number of SDSDQUA-032G-U46A. But if you click on 'Frustration Free Package', the part number changes to SDSDQU-032G-AFFP-A.[Update on Oct 5, 2013]The Sandisk microSDHC card works great in my new Samsung Galaxy S3, without the need for reformat (the default format is FAT32)[Update on Dec 26, 2013]My old test results were limited by the card reader and USB 2.0 port used.

Here are the results from 'CrystalDiskMark 3.01 x64':- Sequential Read speed = 40.0MB/s (was 34.8MB/s when connected to USB 2.0 port)- Sequential Write speed = 13.1MB/s (was 12.6MB/s when connected to USB 2.0 port)",5.0,Top of the class among all (budget-priced) micro-SDHC cards I have tested / Works great in Galaxy S3,1348617600,2012-09-26,803,1428,1505

I installed it in my Samsung Tablet, but could not successfully transfer files using either a USB cable or WiFi.  The file transfer would appear to start, but then would slow down and hang completely.  It did this on every one of multiple attempts, with different file types, and numbers of files ranging from many to just a single file.  I tried loading files onto the card directly from my PC, but then the Tablet would not see them.  I tried reformatting the card both in my PC and in the Tablet, but still got the same result.  After a few tries, the Tablet would appear to format the card but then tell me that the card was blank/unformatted.  I did an A/B/A with an old 8GB Sandisk Micro SD Card that I had laying around.  It worked perfectly -- formating, transferring files, reading and writing files -- everthing worked.  I put the 32GB SanDisk Ultra Card back in the Tablet, but had the same problems again.  I concluded that the SanDisk Ultra card was defective and returned it.

(Read below)Firstly you need to be aware that the Samsung Tablet Model GT-P5113 currently runs with Android OS 4.1.1 with Kernel 3.0.31-523998 and Build number JRO03C.P5113UECLK7.(Jelly Bean) My experiences shared here are with that level of Android OS your experiences may vary depending on what version of OS you are running. The SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC card purchased from Amazon (Retail Packaging) gets recognized just fine however when the tablet's Media Device A.K.A 'MTP' application attempts to talk your PC via USB cable the Tablet simply reboots! and after that the card is presented to the PC. - Really strange indeed!This baffled me for couple of hours. Firstly, I attempted to format the card (exFAT) in PC and it formatted just fine. After that I attempted to use it in the tablet to see the same behavioral oddity of instantaneous reboot of the tablet as 'MTP' application tries to communicate with the PC. This made me investigate the issue further and I determined the root cause was the fact that SANDISK now seen to factory format the card with 'exFAT' but also somehow seen to include an 'offset' of 16MB at the beginning of the card which shows up as 16MB unallocated region in the initial sectors on this card under windows disk management tool.The solution is to get rid of that 'unallocated' 16MB partition on the card. You could do it in PC but that might require some windows command line experience and using 'diskpart' utility and what not and I do not want to confuse people here with that process. For most novice users The process should be very simple, Just insert the card on the tablet and use the 'native' SD Card format tool under 'settings' that Android OS 4.1.1 has and it will get rid of that 16MB partition and happily remount it. Now after this simple process the 'MTP' application works just fine with PC to transfer files to the SD card without any strange reboot phenomenon.Not sure why SANDISK formats their Class 10 card in this fashion (They never did it with their class 6 cards earlier) and there's gotta be some technical explanation for why they include that 16MB partition that only SANDISK can give. In the end if you reformat the card in the tablet (Which defaults to exFAT) the card is seen to work just fine.Bottomline:-----------This is an awesome 64GB capacity MicroSD card from a reputed manufacturer for budget minded people and gets the job done beautifully. The read and write speeds are adequate enough for most Audio,Video & picture file formats in a tablet. The glitch mentioned above forced me to give *Four* stars instead of *Five* stars but let that not stop you from making a decision to buy it.Highly recommended!Cheers!",4.0,Works with GT-P5113 Samsung Tab 2!,1370390400,2013-05-06,581,2,2

I have 5 Class 6 SD 8GB Extreme III series cards all pushing 5 years old now with zero problems, all of which write nearly twice as fast. Not sure what the limitation is, Class 10 UHS-1, and 5 year newer tech should blow these away.  The 'micro' packaging shouldn't make a difference either.  I can only guess it's marketing differentiation.Again this card will write at published specs but you may want to check out the Sony SR32UYA/TQMN of the same capacity, it reads and writes faster and is a similar price, though only a one year warranty. I picked it up with a Hisense 7 Pro tablet (awesome) and couldn't wait, and they were on sale locally for $26. Was a pleasant surprise. Came with a SD adapter as well and some file recovery software (a link).  Not a fan of Sony web sites support or or documentation for any of their gear the last 15 years but these are commodities now I suppose and you can't expect much any longer.

HOWEVER(it's in caps pay attention!), when i took it out of the phone and put the microSD into the SD adapter and plugged into the sd card slot on the front of my pc(win7 x64) it asked to format the card(was already formatted by phone so was confused) so i hit ok, no biggie, it was empty anyways. windows did its thing and when it was &#34;ready to use&#34; it said the card was only 1MB(it showed 59.47GB in the phone). so my troubleshooting section of mind kicked in and i removed the card, and i just so happen to have a microSD slot in my computer's frontal bay and it wouldn't even show it was connected in windows explorer. so i took it out and put in another microsd card, voila it read, switched them out again, and nothing. so i decided to pull up my paragon hard disk utility, and it showed the same thing as windows, regardless how i tried formatting it. i gave up and put it back in the phone and mounted it.my s3 said it neded to be formatted. so i formatted it in the phone again and it showed just like it did the first time, 59.47GB. i then proceeded to install samsung kies and got my phone hooked up to my pc via usb cable, i opened the phone in windows explorer and right there it shows the phone memory at ~16gb and the sd card at 59.47 gb....i'm not quite sure what's going on with that, because the sd slots in my pc read my other cards just fine. but anyway i guess if you plan on using it in your phone or possibly other device exclusively because i can use it like a charm while it's in my phone, otherwise it seems pretty useless. so i guess just depends on what you're using it for. on a side not, be careful when you open the plastic package that contains the micro sd and sd adapter, be sure to open it over a large clear area, i opened it up the the living room with black tile floor and had to get a flashlight to find it when it jumped out on the holder(it just sets in the little plastic holder so even the slightest shake will send it flying when opening) i'm giving it 3/5 on here, but 5/5 if you're getting it for a phone, galaxy s3 at least because it works fine in mine",4.0,be careful with this,1354752000,2012-06-12,909,0,0

AVBMZZAFEKO58,B007WTAJTO,SkincareCEO,"[1568, 1694]","NOTE:  please read the last update (scroll to the bottom) - I'm leaving this review as 1 star as it appears to help others who purchased and had a similar experience.I give SanDisk 5 stars for customer service and 1 star for the product (for those manufactured in the past)  For those newly manufactured products that contain the software ROM fix, I'd give the product 5 stars.To all those who purchased this card due to all the great reviews.... and then used it in a Galaxy S4 (GS4) smartphone for storage, the solution to the problem is not one you can solve without returning the card to SanDisk for a replacement under warranty.  Believe me I tried everything that the Google searches returned as solutions... formatting as exFAT, formatting in the GS4 then copying data to the card while in the phone etc.... nothing worked... and so now please stop pulling out your hair and hopefully you will get the same result which I hope to get soon (just RMA'd and will send it back tomorrow for a free replacement under warranty).The problem (As confirmed from the SanDisk customer support rep when I asked specifically asked him):- When used in the GS4, this card will unmount itself inadvertently (may be true only for cards manufactured before the ROM patch described below was implemented in manufacturing).  This can cause the data to become corrupt (luckily was not my experience) and / or can be very frustrating as most of us are saving 13 MP camera pictures to the card (or MP4 movies that stop in the middle of the movie) and it unmounts when you view the picture in the gallery or worse, right when you take the picture (this was the issue I experienced).- SanDisk knows about this issue.  Again, SANDISK KNOWS ABOUT THE ISSUE AND WILL REPLACE YOUR CARD. Call them (info below) and they WILL take care of it under warranty.  They have a good name for a reason and they want to keep it. (sorry SanDisk about the 1 star, but I thought it was the way to get the message out to those searching for a solution)- The customer rep told me that SanDisk tried to work with Samsung to resolve the issue but Samsung refused to acknowledge a problem exists with this card and some of their phones (especially their flagship GS4 phones).- The customer rep told me that to their knowledge the card works fine in regular cameras (not Samsung GS4 phones with cameras, obviously) and even worked fine in some phones from HTC etc. that could accommodate the 64 GB cards. Hence the 5 star ratings from others.- The solution SanDisk came up with was to write a patch into the ROM of the card itself to specifically address the issue on Samsung GS4 phones (and maybe other Samsung phones like the GS3).  I was assured that the new card I would get would work flawlessly. will see in about 3 weeks.- I purchased my card from Amazon June 2013, so the ones currently being manufactured and the one I should get will have the new patch.  However, as SanDisk manufactures in batches (like most of the industry), old batches of ""unpatched"" cards obviously exist in warehouses.- I asked about a software patch I could download and was told it's not possible... hence the ""hard coded patch"" in the card's ROMSo... how to take care of the problem....After speaking with the SanDisk US customer support (link and info below), this is what I learned and did.Go to the SanDisk site1) [...]2) call consumer products support (this is the US no.) 1-866-SANDISK (726-3475)3) Tell them that the card is unmounting itself in your GS4 (I assume this is also a problem experienced by GS3 owners too)4) They will then confirm your information, approve your return (10-15 min approval window by mine was basically instantaneously), and then send you emails with a UPS return label and instructions.5) BTW, they also asked if I had a magnifying glass to ID the serial no. on the card, but I didn't and couldn't read it myself (those numbers are super small printed into the plastic... don't believe me?  take a look yourself.)  I told the rep I couldn't read them and he said no problem, they would process without the serial no.  I assume this is because they send you a new replacement card only when they receive your card you send in.  Makes sense.Well, that's it.  Problem (hopefully) solved.  Let's see in 2-3 weeks.  The rep was super nice about it and seemed like they were all too familiar with the problem.  KUDOS TO SANDISK FOR TAKING CARE OF IT... however, it would be nice if there was some type of communication / notice of the issue besides Google info sources, forums etc.  I spent hours, maybe a couple of days total hours worth, thinking it was an issue with my phone / my data transfer.  oh well, that's how it goes.I really hope that this review helps some of you out there with the same problem as me.  GOOD LUCK!!(btw, I'd give the card 5 stars if this problem was solved in the patched ROM of newer cards as the data transfer speeds are awesome on the card (tested transferring data via a card reader hooked to my computer)... if the data transfer / remaining mounted in the GS4 issue never existed (pre-patch of ROM, of course))UPDATE: 08/17/2013 - All went well with the return of the SanDisk Storage card.  UPS shipping took about 2 days from when I sent it, SanDisk verified the warranty claim 1 day later and 5 hours later that same day, my replacement card had been shipped. waiting on the new card now, but expect to test it out very soon (early next week).  will update the post after testing out the new card.  Just as a reference, I've been using a 32GB Micro SD HC SanDisk card in the GS4 since having shipped the 64GB card.  Obviously it's a different card and not the Micro SD XC kind. Other than a bit slower access speeds to the card, absolutely zero problems.... well if you don't count that it's basically filled up, hence why the 64GB option is great on the GS4. So it proves the point on the problem with the early build Micro SD XC 64GB cards.I'm happy to see that my review has helped some others out there.  Good luck to you in your warranty claim. my experience with SanDisk customer support has been excellent so far.Update: 08/21/2013 - Received the new replacement SanDisk Storage card just a few days ago (shipping back to me once they agreed it was defective was a very short time window).  Have had it running in the Galaxy S4 for a few days now without any jumps, stutters or card unloading in the middle of picture or video taking.  Card seems to work flawlessly as the SanDisk Rep mentioned it would. One would think it's such a short time to test after a few days of use, but if this were not fixed already it would have dismounted in the first 45 minutes... that's how often and how fast it was occurring. so it would seem the problem is solved. The new SD card makes the phone even more responsive when moving between pictures in the gallery and performing other tasks like copying files to the card.  Thanks SanDisk!  Unless I update this review by next week, you will know that the problem has been fixed.Good luck to those with similar problems as we now know how to get it fixed thanks to SanDisks great responsive customer service.Update: 08/31/2013 - This is the last update to this review just to ""close the loop"".  The new replacement card from SanDisk has been running flawlessly for about 2 weeks now.  I have not experienced any of the initial problems.  SanDisk really did fix the issues in the new batch of cards.Update: 12/09/2013 - The card has been running in my GS4 flawlessly since replacing it around Aug 21st.  Pretty good track record so far (~ 3.5 months) so it appears to be fixed with the newly manufactured (replacement) cards.For those that have left comments that I should change the rating upwards now that the issue is fixed (see my addition at the beginning of this review)... When searching for a solution to a problem with a purchased product, most people start at the 1 star reviews to see what others have experienced.  This is especially true for products with a lot of reviews (this is what I did in the beginning with this product).  Therefore I think leaving it at 1 star and adding the comments at the beginning should clarify the review.Thanks to review commenter ""Da Shocker"" for his input.  I think he sums it up very well when it comes to the value of files stored on media like this:""One more thing.. to those not happy with the one star rating by this person go ahead buy one. Take tons of pics vids and save some music on there then when the card crashes come back and give it a five star. A card cost $50-$100 pictures from a vacation or family event are priceless..

That's why this little package is so handy.  You get both in one neat little package and at 64GB, you'll have plenty of space to store most of your programs, files, etc on your device.The Class 10 rating (ability to move data on/off card at the current maximum speed) is a must for anyone that doesn't want to sit for vital seconds waiting for data to write to the card.  And SanDisk has proven themselves over the years as making a quality product.  Sure, you may occasionally find a dud in their inventory, but they are quick to fix/replace it and that is what matters most.  Buying cheaper cards will land you with a read/write error when you can least afford it.  Don't be the person that loses those important family photos or that document that is due today because of a cheap and defective card.I purchased this particular card for my Asus Transformer, as it fits nicely into the pad itself - and with the optional keyboard attachment (which is capable of holding standard SD cards) it fits there as well.  Making this the perfect solution for my extra memory needs and at a much better bargain than most competitors.

And although I haven't tried it on other devices, I think if it works flawlessly on the GoPro, it will work even better on anything else...So at first I thought maybe since it's only 30mbps there may be frame rate issues with recording (even though I knew that shouldn't be the case). Well after popping it in, the GoPro says 9hr14min (1080p super view video) which is insane. I put it on my helmet and took it for a spin. When I came home after spending the day on the bike, the HD quality was spectacular (granted it's all thanks to the camera itself), but it was smooth, with zero frame rate issues. The only flaw is the semi long time it takes to copy files to your hard drive as it copies at only 30mbps, but honestly that's really no big deal and totally worth it still.Bottom line, this SD plus the GoPro 3+ is the best camera combination for your money.P.S.

Roth ""AKA GeneralEclectic""","[4, 4]","Once you cut and pry your way through Sandisk's packaging, you will be rewarded with a nicely-made and high-performing MicroSD UHS1 flash memory.  It comes formatted to SD.org's standards in FAT32, so it's ready to go for most applications.  My single gripe about this product is that they have omitted the usual small plastic box that holds the card and adapter.  I use those!  Since I frequently switch cards between uses, and frequently have them in storage, those little boxes are very useful.  It's way too easy to lose a MicroSD.Anyway, here are the results from ATTO disk benchmark:Settings (anticipating digicam use): Total length 64MB Overlapped I/O and QD=4 (but it never exceeds 1)Segment Size in Kbytes, Read/Write in Kbyte/secSize  Write  Read.5  9904  163431  14555  170332  13454  273244  14194  353378  15065  3985316  14154  4062932  14277  4295764  13212  44291128  17567  44247256  16209  44442512  15391  444421024  17408  444422048  16229  44442[Sorry for the ugly table, Amazon does not support consecutive spaces, including alt-255, or embedded tabs]This is very fast for a MicroSD.  It's not quite up to what Sandisk achieves in full size UHS1 SD cards that can write over twice this speed, but those are electronically more complex cards. The Micro form factor likely doesn't permit the additional hardware to achieve speeds comparable to the larger cards.  Note that the read speed is a lot faster than what Sandisk promises.  (Note also that you will NOT achieve these speeds with a USB2 reader.  You will need either a USB3 or built-in PCIe reader to get accurate results.  So do not complain to me if you use a USB2 reader and don't achieve these speeds.)In any event, you'd be hard-pressed to find anything faster.My personal experience with Sandisk products is very good.  That is, I've never had anything fail on me.  Given the very reasonable prices of these, I rate them as Highly Recommended.",5.0,Fast!,1345680000,2012-08-23,837,4,4

Unless you are shooting HD videos though, chances are you're not going to fill this card up in a day.Unless you either need the storage for HD video or something or your data is not important I'd say it makes more sense to just get several  16GB cards equaling 64GB at roughly the same or less price depending on brand.Again Sandisk support was great and they even asked if I needed data retrieved.

AWKYTPVNNZELL,B007WTAJTO,"T. Brown ""TB""","[1, 1]","Maybe there is nothing that can be done and it is just the way the technology is at this time, but to me it seems that the 64GB SD cards have very limited uses at this time because they are formatted in whats called ""exFAT32"" instead of the standard FAT32 to get 64GB from a 32GB card.  After receiving my card and inserting it into my new android tablet with, Jelly Bean, it was recognized and it did show I had 59GB available.  I then removed the card from the tablet and inserted it into my computers, a Win7 and a Vista, and tried to transfer files, photos and videos from my laptop to the card they WOULD NOT TRANSFER!  After some research on the internet it appeared that the card had to be reformatted from the new ""exFAT32"" to the standard FAT32.  All my files were created in Win XP and Win Vista - FAT32.  I also have a Win7 machine I recently purchased and can easily move all types of files between all the machines and memory cards and flash drives but could not transfer any files to this card from any computer as long as the card was formatted in exFAT32.  I had read on the internet about reformatting  the cards and it working.  My Win7 machine does not even have the option to format to standard FAT32, it only has NSTF and exFAT32.  My older computers have the older FAT32 format option and it took my Vista computer with a Dual Core processor 1  hours to reformat the card to FAT32.  After reformatting I was able to easily transfer my files, photos, and videos on my XP and Vista computers BUT not the Win7 computer.  The card works in my tablet and I am able to access and use all the files I transferred to the card in FAT32 with my Vista computer on the tablet.  BUT after reformatting it now the card only has 27GB of space available, so it was essentially reformatted the 64GB card into a 32GB card.  I will keep the card because I have a lot of work into it reformatting and transferring files and hopefully in the future I can reformat it again back to exFAT32 if and when exFAT32 catches on and an OS is made that can seamlessly use files created in both FAT32 and exFAT32.  This seems to be a good card that works well in certain situations but my advice do your research on what you have and how you will use the card because this is not simply a big GB card that can be used for everything in every device, unless ALL your files, photos, and videos are in, or will be created with, exFAT32 there are some real draw backs to this card and you might be better off just buying multiple lower GB cards if you really need this much storage space in a Micro SD card.  Or perhaps cards you already own can be reformatted into exFAT32 and double the capacity if your computer has the exFAT32 reformat option.  I have not tried it but based on my experience the last few days it seems like it would work if exFAT32 works for you. I gave 3 stars because it does work, but I feel Sandisk not fully explaining how they are getting 64GB out of this card and the possible problems a consumer might have with it is misleading advertising.",3.0,Works but BEWARE exFAT32,1376956800,2013-08-20,475,1,1

I loaded a handful of videos from my PC and then installed this in my Android tablet for a trip. Corrupted. Nothing worked and sometimes it can be seen, other times it doesn't even show up. The tablet wants to format it, which it has never been able to do successfully, and needless to say it is too small to even be a paperweight. The SD adapter that it came with was also junk and upon the first time I went to use it, it simply didn't feel right--- so I used my trusty Lexar micro SD to USB that came with my Lexar 32gb micro SD card.I would have expected more and unfortunately as it stands many people have success with them working and equally those that do not. I have even formatted it to see if it made any difference and there was none. And of course my window of return is gone so unless the seller stands behind it--- it is going in the trash. I knew I should have gone with what I had purchased before as I have three of them working perfectly for over a year. Moreover what is even a bigger disappointment is that our camera that uses a standard SD card and it is a no-name with no identifying marks---- has worked for two years without a problem.I do know problems arise, but..... when the cost of a product goes up and up and the quality control goes down--- I am not going to be the one accepting those terms. If you're looking for a good card, search Amazon for this one: LSDMI32GBSBNAR.

A1PPMB99YNFPRH,B007WTAJTO,Tom Dowd,"[1, 2]","Monday, November 26, 2012I put this in the Galaxy S3 without formatting, restarted the phone and it showed 59.4g GB of space.  I transferred all the files from the old 16 GB card and then moved all my music to the card with the phone connected to my computer by the USB cord.  Still lots of space left and the various music players seem to see all the music.Tuesday, November 27, 2012The card didn't show up on the phone this afternoon.  No message, just no songs to play and no card according to everything I could check on the phone.  I restarted the phone and got a notification that the SD card was corrupt, needed formatting and that I would loose all data on the card.  I restarted the phone again, without formatting, and the card came up like it had never been missing.  I am writing this on Thursday, 11/29 and I have not had another issue with the card.December 6Well, I don't know what to think.  The card disappeared again and I reformatted it FAT32 in an attempt to fix the problem.  The whole point of getting this large card was to have my music on my phone and not have to stream it from the cloud.  I tried several music players and went with PowerAmp because of the good reviews and that I could specify the folder to play from.  So PowerAmp is looking for the folder /mnt/extSdCard/Music and playing the songs in all the subfolders.  It is PowerAmp that tells me that folder is not available.The card has gone missing one other time and restarting the phone fixed the problem.Today, PowerAmp would not play and when I got home I found the Music folder was gone.  I also had Ringtones folder and it was also gone.  Now, I may not be the sharpest saw in the shed, but I know I did not delete those folders.  The card had other folders but not those two so it had not been reformatted.I am starting to think the problem is with the Galaxy S3.  I had a 16 GB FAT32 card in this phone that had been in my previous HTC phone.  That card was not large enough to held my music so I don't know if it was disappearing or not.  I wish this combination of phone and 64GB card was more reliable but just don't know where the problem lies.I lowered the stars from 4 to 3 but I really don't know if the problem is with the card, the phone or both.  All I know is that they do not seem to be playing well together.December 7There was a notification on the phone this morning that the SD card was corrupted and needed to be formatted.  I restarted the phone several times and got the notification each time.  I reformatted the SD card using the phone, a step I don't think I have tried yet.December 8Another MINOR problem I have is that the message counter gets stuck on 1 when I have no new messages.  The only fix I have found is to restart the phone.  That happened this morning and I got the corrupted card message again, but restarted again and the card came up OK.December 11So, the files on the card keep disappearing.  The card is mounted and the phone shows the correct free memory but PowerAmp, and file directory programs do not see any files on the card.  I restart the phone and the files come back.  Very strange.  I played music on and off all day today without a problem and then this evening all the files disappeared again. Restarted the phone and all is well again.December 15My phone upgraded to 4.1.1 yesterday and the same issues remain.  It is a crap shoot as to if music will play.  I take a lot of photos and use the service Zenfolio to store and display them.  I have an app that syncs with Zenfolio and keeps a phone size version of the photos on my phone.  I set this app to store the photos on the Samsung SD card and have similar issues with it when the data on the phone goes away.  This morning the SD card came up as corrupt again after a restart to get the data back.  It took a total of 3 restarts to get the music and photos back.December 18I have been trying to play music stored on this card today and my phone has reset several times.  Very frustrating.  I ordered a SanDisk 32 GB Mobile microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-032G-AFFP today for about $25.00 and I'll see if I have the same issues.  Very disappointing.December 28I purchased and installed theSanDisk 32 GB Mobile microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-032G-AFFPand copied all the files from the 64GB card to the new 32GB card.  No formatting, no fuss, no muss.  I have not had a phone reset since, have played music through Bluetooth for hours in the car, have viewed photos.  Everything just works.  Half the memory but what I have is always available and the phone works, a good trade off.  I am still disappointed that the 64GB did not work with the SG3.

A1WTQUOQ4WG9AI,B007WTAJTO,"Tom Henriksen ""Doggy Diner""","[82, 109]","Hi:I ordered two card and they arrived the next day, even faster than Prime. Unfortunatey, this 64gb MicroSD card is designed to only work with ex-fat. If you're an ex-fat fan and don't ever plan to change, this is the card for you. I've been able to take all of the previous 64gb MicroSD cards I've ordered, put them in an adapter and format them in my Windows 7 desktop. I'm a NTSF fan and find it to be much more stable in tablets.With other cards that aren't intentionally crippled, I can format the card to NTSF on Monday, ex-fat on Tuesday, Fat32 on Wednesday. It's ex-fat or the highway for SanDisk.You can use EaseUS Partition Master to format the card to Fat32 for devices such as cameras and mp3 players and many, many, many others that don't support ex-fat. That being said, you only get one shot. Once it's formatted into Fat32, attempting to format back to Exfat or NTSF hoses the card. I couldn't reformat to NTSF no matter what I tried. Once again, don't bother trying to format in your computer, ex-fat is the only choice.Any card that needs a special utility to format to anything other than ex-fat shouldn't be supported. Don't buy it! It's designed to fail.Shame on you Sandisk!Update 9/24/12:***************************I spoke with Sandisk technical support and they confirmed that Sandisk Ultra 64gb MicroSd cards are not compatible with Android 4.0 and above. This would be for Class 10, SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-064G-U46A as well as SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 30MB/s Memory Card with SD Adapter (NEW VERSION) - Retail Packaging with Komputerbay SDXC USB Reader.I did not have any success formatting the class 10 card with EaseUS Partition Master. SanDisk recommended the free utility, HPUSBDISK.exe and I successfully downloaded it from Softpedia. I was  unable to format the card with NTSF but successfully converted one of the cards to Fat32 for a friend who wants to use it in a SanDisk mp3 player, that of course is not compatible with ex-fat.Acting on Sandisk advice I am returning the unopened class ten cards with the KomputerBay reader. I spoke with a patient and gracious tier-one tech support person and the party line seems be that consumers only use MicroSD cards in phones. I don't know what they're thinking: cameras, mp3 players, tablets, adapters and so on. Anyway it's a known issue.I can confirm that the class 6  64gb MicroSD card can be formatted in Windows7 back and forth to most any format so after returning four class 10 cards, I'm back to class six.It's still unconscionable to deliberately design these cards to be incompatible. I hope SanDisk will come up with a solution or recall the cards. Buyer beware.Update: 9/29/12**********************I received my two replacement class 6, 64gb MicroSD cards and it took less than five minutes to open the horrible packaging and to perform a quick format to NTSF. Done!I gave my friend the Class 10 64gb MicroSD card formatted into Fat32 by HPUSBDISK.EXE and he couldn't read it on his computer. As it turns out, the class 10 cards are not only incompatible with most devices bur also with most usb card readers.  Another trip across town.I can confirm that the IOGEAR SD/MicroSD/MMC Card Reader/Writer GFR204SD (Green/Gray) selling on Amazon for $6.99 works. So after countless hours of wasted effort, my friend has a card formatted to Fat32 that works with a SanDisk mp3 player.Once again, SanDisk has admitted that these cards are not compatible with Androd 4.0 or above, that being 100% of Android tablets and a majority of Android phones. These cards are intentionally crippled by design.To quote a friend:""Per the SDHC standard, the format is FAT32. SDXC (64 GB and larger) the spec calls for exFAT. Microsoft has limited the OS to only format larger cards as exFAT and will not allow FAT32. Also, seems they have found a way to also block NTFS. Thus far, very few Android devices can read exFAT because they refuse to pay M$ for licensing of the exFAT file system. ""To all masochists out there--buy this card.

Two 32GB cards went into a camera and a cell phone which only accept up to 32GB cards -- and one 64GB card went into my Samsung Galaxy S3 cell phone. The second 64GB card's a spare.The Galaxy S3 phone accepted the 64GB MicroSD card with no problems -- except for the fact that my Galaxy S3 only recognizes 59.7GB of the 64GB MicroSD card. I have no idea why it does that and why I lost over 5GB of an empty MicroSD card but I'm okay with that -- I guess. 60GB's is still plenty. The transfers of music, videos, and pictures between the phone's internal 16GB memory and the 64GB MicroSD card is wayyy faster than the old SanDisk 16GB MicroSD card that was in there. The same noticeably faster speeds between my desktop computer and the 64GB MicroSD card were also smile inspiring.As for the SanDisk MicroSD cards -- they work great and seem to operate pretty darn fast. They're definitely faster than the old 16GB SanDisk MicroSD cards I had installed in my camera and cell phone(s).Now -- as for the shipping -- dismal! I ordered two 32GB along with two 64GB MicroSD cards on August 21 during an Amazon Gold Box sale. According to the tracking feature they didn't even transmit the shipping info to the carrier (USPS) until August 31. All four were shipped together. I didn't receive them until September 6 -- a full 16 days after I ordered. A little over two weeks for four tiny items that were indicated on the Amazon page as being -- ""In Stock. Ships from and sold by Amazon.com"" -- at the time of purchase. They also shipped all four tiny MicroSD card packages in a way over-sized box which the USPS couldn't fit into the mailbox so I had to make a cross-town trip to the US Post Office and stand in a very long and slow moving line to pick up the box. They could have all four EASILY fit in one small envelope. Even a small padded envelope. I left packaging feedback on that already.This is the 3rd straight time that Amazon shipping was horrible over the last several months -- and that is why the 2-star rating. This is not the Amazon shipping that I remember.",2.0,Horrible Shipping,1347062400,2012-08-09,851,0,1

Highly recommended. Now, some test the Transend microSD as faster (see first commend for one URL), but performance is more likely limited by your reader.

A2DKQQIZ793AV5,B007WTAJTO,Twister,"[45, 49]","Sandisk announcement of the first 128GB micro SD took internet by storm. Our phones evolved into multimedia powerhouses with 5.5&#34;-6&#34; displays, desktop grade processing power, OTG support for external peripheral accessories, powerful cameras, and more. The only thing was missing a super high capacity internal removable storage at an affordable price. 128GB micro SD announcement finally filled that gap, supported by amazon current sale of $119 shipped, but the question still remained if some of the older smartphones will be able to handle/recognize this capacity. I was personally curious considering original Note 2 spec was calling for support of up to 64GB only.Now, about the card itself. Its their Ultra edition with a read speeds of up 30MB/s and Class 10 performance. As part of Ultra edition it's considered to be waterproof, temperature-proof, x-ray-proof, magnet-proof, and also shockproof. In addition to a flash card itself, it also includes SD adapter for compatibility with digital cameras and also direct reading on laptops/PCs support SD card.So here comes the verdict: IT WORKS with Note 2!!! My Note 2 is all stock, Verizon SCH-I605 version, running stock Android 4.3. I checked the card first with an adapter on my laptop and then mounted it on my Note 2 where it was recognized with a right capacity. I also ran A1 SD Benchmark app (both long and accurate benchmark tests) to verify it with success. Read/write speed were not quite near 30MB/s, but it's still pretty good.My opinion? This card takes multimedia powerhouse Note 2 to the next level!!! Now you don't have to be limited and can store your favorite albums in FLAC audio format, or have a small library of your favorite movies stored permanently, or take more high def videos, and so on. Just always stay up to date with backups. If flash card fails, it will be covered under warranty, but your pictures and videos will be lost forever.",5.0,Super high capacity!!!

Said it was fixed, but the bad cards must still be sitting in warehouses.

Once you have found out and that you can in fact use such an SD...go and search online for HDD Raw Copy Tool from HDD GURU...and it will allow you to make an image of your old SD to apply to the new SD and/or even make a backup of one's SD.  Since the SD drives are different sizes when this image is applied to the larger...you will need to use a partition manager, such as MiniTool partition wizard (which is free for home use) and resize the partition of the larger drive.

A1KZTXT7ZEBCE5,B007WTAJTO,Z Guy,"[0, 0]","I purchased the Sandisk Ultra 32GB microSDHC for some extra storage room for my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. I was considering the 64 GB, but went with this card because I have the 64GB version on my Galaxy Note 2 phone and I have never come close to needing all that space. Granted, I don't store any music on my phone but I do take a lot of photos/videos and store as many apps on the microSDHC card rather than use the phone's internal memory.For the cost savings of going with the smaller 32GB card, it was a no brainer.The card has worked flawlessly since I installed it on my tablet and have had no problems with it whatsoever. Plus Sandisk is a big name in storage so again, it's a no brainer--- buy it!",4.0,Great Extra Storage Space For Your Tablet,1389398400,2014-11-01,37,0,0
A176OYR7KGC1PC,B007WTAJTO,zhengziying,"[1, 2]","DO NOT PUT ANY IMPORTANT DATA IN IT. DO NOT USE IT AS A PERMANENT STORAGE TO ARCHIVE IMPORTANT FILES.It just failed after 1.5 months use -- i don't use it too much. Just put all my digital pictures (total: about 30GB) in it and carried in my wallet. I added some more pictures to the disk for a few time in November. Tonight, when I insert it into my laptop, Windows say cannot recognize the disk and said it must be formatted. I tried my MacBook Air and got the same. Neither Mac nor Windows can read it. I formatted it and started to copy the 30+GB pictures again. The copy broke in half way. Cancelled the copy, reinserted the disk and tried to resume the copy. Windows said the volumn is back and told me I must run chkdsk. I ran chkdsk and retried the copy. Still the same failure.I guess the disk has some problem and I don't bother recovering it, since it's not going to be reliable as I expected. Very disappointed. Thought SanDisk is a very good brand. I use SanDisk's CF card in my camera for years and it worked fine. I will fall back to use hard disk to backup my ditigal pictures.So it should be find to use this microSD disk to exchange some large file with friends. But don't put important data in it. Be prepard that it can fail at any time.",1.0,failed in 1.5 months,1354665600,2012-05-12,940,1,2
